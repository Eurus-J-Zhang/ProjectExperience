# Project Experience
This repository collects the main projects and courses I have done during my Master of Human-Computer Interaction.

It is used as an additional portfolio when applying for master thesis position and/or PhD positions.

MineSweeper and VoiceMaze are Java projects that practised developing User Interfaces.

Cognitive Neuroscience is a summer intern on processing the MEG data.

The others are course work with coding assignments.
