This is the course work on Artifical Intelligence, which is one of my favourite courses in my Master's. 

The content covers the basis of AI's most important industrial applications, 
in control and management of complex systems, information technology, and autonomous systems and robotics. It includes:

* Search and problem-solving
* Constraint solving, deduction, logic, and automated reasoning
* Probabilistic inference and reasoning about uncertainty
* Semantic technologies
* Sequential decision-making, decision-making under uncertainty
* Game-theoretic and adversarial decision-making
* Adaptation and learning, especially reinforcement learning

My contribution was to develop and complete the codes that the teacher provided. It improved my skills of reading and writing in Python, as well as my knowledge on AI and its implementations.
