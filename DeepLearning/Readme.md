The content of course is about Machine learning with deep neural networks. And the programming part used PyTorch packages.

The course includes the basic principles of deep learning, such as:
* multi-layer perceptrons, 
* convolutional and recurrent neural networks; 
* stochastic gradient descent and backpropagation; 
* means to prevent overfitting;

It also increases my experience on
* supervised learning and unsupervised learning with neural networks; 
* modern neural architectures used for image classification, time series modeling and natural language processing; 
* training deep learning models in PyTorch.
